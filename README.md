# Handwriting-Detection-using-Detr
Worked on a research project that utilized Detr model for handwriting detection.

Detr was impleemnted by facebook as a transformer model. Though the outcome of this is ambivalent given the limited access to hardware required for training the model for longer hours.

How to run?
Well change the paths to file. Please check that you have proper annotations
USE: https://github.com/jsbroks/coco-annotator for annotating your dataset. Not a compulsion but a pretty good tool.

Now train and save the model. For the last code please assure that you are accessing the correct labels.
